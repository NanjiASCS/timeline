        </h2>
        <p>Destiny launches in September 2014 and has two DLC's throughout the year.
            These were "The Dark Below" and "The House of Wolves"
            During this time "The Vault of Glass" and "Crota's End" raids and the "Prison of Elders" arena
            were the prominent endgame activities.

            Destiny Year 2 "The Taken King" 2015-2016
        </h2>
    
        <p>In September 2015 "The Taken King" DLC was released, adding more content to the game.
            This is commonly regarded as the best DLC the hame has had.
        "King's Fall" was the featured raid and is known as the hardest raid in the games history.
            A revamped version of Prison of Elders known as "Challenge of Elders" was added in April.

     </h2>

        <p> September 2016 kicked off with the "Rise of Iron" DLC.
            This was my personal favorite year for this game.
            This DLC featured "Wrath of the Machine" my favorite raid of all time.
            In April the "Age of Triumph" update was added that brought all the old raids to current level
            reviving the gear from them back into the game.

             In September 2017 "Destiny 2" launched easily starting the worst year in the games history.

             The featured raid was "Leviathan" and two mini rades in the same location known as "Eater of Worlds" and "Spire of Stars."
